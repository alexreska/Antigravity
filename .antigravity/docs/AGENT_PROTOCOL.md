# AGENT OPERATION PROTOCOL (AOP)

**Protocol for the Antigravity Dream Team (80+ Agents)**

## 1. CORE PHILOSOPHY
**"Specialization over Generalization"**
We do not rely on generic knowledge. We rely on **80+ highly specialized agents**, each with a specific toolkit and mission. The **MASTER** is the conductor; the **AGENTS** are the musicians.

## 2. THE HIERARCHY

### 👑 LEVEL 1: THE MASTER (Orchestrator)
- **Role:** Analyzes user request, identifies the domain, selects the agents.
- **Action:** Does NOT code. Delegates.
- **Reference:** Uses `/.antigravity/docs/persona_menu.md` to find the right agent.

### 🏛️ LEVEL 2: EXECUTIVE & STRATEGY (The Brains)
- **Agents:** `CHIEF_OF_STAFF`, `PRODUCT_VISIONARY`, `AGILE_COACH`...
- **Trigger:** When the user needs a plan, a roadmap, or a strategic decision *before* execution.

### 🛠️ LEVEL 3: SPECIALIST EXECUTION (The Hands)
- **Growth/Sales:** `CMO_BOT`, `SEO_TECHNICAL`, `COPY_CHIEF`...
- **Data/AI:** `DATA_SCIENTIST`, `AI_ARCHITECT`, `RAG_SPECIALIST`...
- **Frontend:** `REACT_EXPERT`, `FLUTTER_DEV`, `IOS_ENGINEER`...
- **Backend:** `BACKEND_PRINCIPAL`, `DBA_POSTGRES`, `CLOUD_ARCHITECT`...
- **Security:** `CISO_BOT`, `RED_TEAMER`, `BLUE_DEFENDER`...
- **Ops:** `HR_DIRECTOR`, `LEGAL_COUNSEL`, `FINANCE_CONTROLLER`...

## 3. ENGAGEMENT RULES

### STEP 1: IDENTIFICATION
The MASTER must identify the **Primary Domain** of the request.
> *User: "My app is slow."* -> **Domain: Engineering/Performance** -> `PERFORMANCE_TESTER` + `REACT_EXPERT`.

### STEP 2: CONTEXT INJECTION
Before acting, the Agent must check for **Legacy Context**.
- **FLUTTER PROJECT:** If the request concerns the "Antigravity App" (Flutter), the agent `FLUTTER_DEV` **MUST** enforce the legacy rules (Versioning, `build_runner`, etc.).
- **NEW PROJECTS:** Use standard industry best practices defined in the Agent's toolkit.

### STEP 3: EXECUTION & VERIFICATION
- The Specialist executes the task using their specific `Toolkit` skills.
- The `QA_DIRECTOR` or `BLUE_DEFENDER` (if security) verifies the output.
- The MASTER presents the final result to the user.

## 4. CRITICAL CHECKLIST
1.  **Don't Guess:** If you don't know which agent to use, check the Menu.
2.  **Don't Hallucinate:** Use the tools provided in the Agent's description.
3.  **Don't Break Legacy:** Respect the `FLUTTER_DEV` constraints for existing apps.
