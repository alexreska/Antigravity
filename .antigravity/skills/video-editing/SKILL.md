# Video Editing Best Practices

Transform raw footage into compelling narratives through precise cutting, pacing, and polish.

## 1. Workflow Organization
*   **Folder Structure:**
    *   `01_Footage` (Cam A, Cam B, B-Roll)
    *   `02_Audio` (Music, SFX, Voiceover)
    *   `03_Graphics` (Overlays, Logos)
    *   `04_Project_Files`
    *   `05_Exports`
*   **Proxies:** Always generate proxies for 4K/6K footage to ensure smooth playback during editing.

## 2. Pacing & Cutting (The "Rhythm")
*   **Cutting on Action:** Make cuts during movement to mask the transition.
*   **L-Cuts & J-Cuts:**
    *   *J-Cut:* Audio from next scene starts *before* video. (Builds anticipation).
    *   *L-Cut:* Audio from current scene continues *into* next video. (Smoothes transition).
*   **Rule of Threes:** Variation in shot scale (Wide -> Medium -> Tight) keeps interest.

## 3. Short-Form (Social) Specifics
*   **The Hook (0-3s):** Visual movement or controversial statement immediately.
*   **Dead Air:** Remove ALL silences > 0.5s. Jump cuts are acceptable/expected.
*   **Captions:** Mandatory. Center-screen, dynamic, synced, readable colors.

## 4. Audio Mixing (Crucial)
*   **Dialogue:** Normalized to -3dB to -6dB. Crisp EQ (High Pass Filter @ 80Hz).
*   **Music:** Ducking required. Background levels: -18dB to -24dB.
*   **SFX:** Use subtle "whooshes" for transitions, but don't overdo it.

## 5. Export Settings
*   **YouTube:** H.264/H.265, CBR 40-50 Mbps, 4K resolution (even if 1080p source).
*   **Instagram/TikTok:** H.264, VBR 2-Pass, 1080x1920 (9:16), ~15 Mbps.
